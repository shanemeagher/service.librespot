# Note
Development has moved to https://github.com/awiouy/LibreELEC.tv/tree/librespot/packages/addons/service/librespot with discussion on the LibreELEC forum here: https://forum.libreelec.tv/thread/8438-librespot-addon/

# service.librespot
*service.librespot* is an LibreELEC service addon based on librespot (https://github.com/plietar/librespot), 
an open source client library for Spotify. *librespot* enables applications to 
use Spotify's service, without using the official but closed-source 
libspotify.

## Building
*service.librespot* must be built from within the LibreELEC build system.
The contents of the sevice.librespot directory must be copied to 
'/packages/addons/service/librespot'.

Currently, only x86_64, RPi and RPi2 builds are possible.

The librespot library is not compiled directly as of yet. If you know how to 
compile Rust from within LibreELEC feel free to add.

## Development
Currently the addon panics on x86_64 (others untested) on first start (if avahi running). See TODO file.
